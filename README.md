# Master-Thesis

The code and the model in this repository is a modified version of [DECAGON](https://github.com/mims-harvard/decagon), a convolutional neural network created by Marinka Zitnik and colaborators. In that repository can be found the requirements for the computational environment. <br>
To run the code, you must first download the database used in DECAGON in [here](http://snap.stanford.edu/decagon/) and save it in `/data/orig_data/`
